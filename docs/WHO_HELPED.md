# Making personal adjustments

Like any standard, this project should rub some the wrong way, by making you do
things in a different manner than your personal preference. This is intentional,
in that the first thing a boot camp is force the student to adjust to corporate 
enterprise standards.

# Which standards, though?

Hopefully you would find most of the standards herein most like the corporate 
standards on your first job. But there will always be differences, such as 
Maven vs Gradle.
