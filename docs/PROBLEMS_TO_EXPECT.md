# Known Issues to Expect

- A smooth maven import may fail??? if your IDE is not already set up to function
as both a java 11 runtime and also build compiler

Since this is something well worth doing anyway (required for some later functionality
within the scope of later projects) it is worth wrestling through these issues.

Please consider documenting your process if you feel others could gain from your experience.
