# Other stuff I had to do to create this template

- for intellij I had to add java 11 jdk to the intellij setup
- had to make lots of maven adustments especially regarding java 11 jdk
- all IDE files were intentionally gitignored to make for easy sharing
- had to copy in the junit examples manually
