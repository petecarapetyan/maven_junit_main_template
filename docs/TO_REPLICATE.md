# How to replicate the structure of this project?

This template was initially created using a standard maven archetype

See https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html

## Why this structure instead of another?

The structure created by the maven archetype is thought to be the likeliest corporate standard

## What about these other approaches?

- manual such as bash shell or windows explorer
- Spring Boot
- Gradle tooling
- Eclipse IDE
- IntelliJ IDE
- VSCode IDE
- shell scripts
- Chef or other similar
- custom maven archetypes

These are all valid approaches.
