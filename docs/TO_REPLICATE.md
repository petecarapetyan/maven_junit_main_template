# How to replicate the structure of this project?

## Git

This project was set up in github first, then cloned to local - not the other way around.
 This strategy seems to be the friendliest setup for a github project
 
It was then changed to a github template after creating and testing.

## Java Maven

This java maven structure was initially created using a standard maven archetype

See https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html


## Why this structure instead of another?

The structure created by the maven archetype is thought to be the likeliest corporate standard

## What about these other approaches?

- manual such as bash shell or windows explorer
- Spring Boot
- Gradle tooling
- Eclipse IDE
- IntelliJ IDE
- VSCode IDE
- shell scripts
- Chef or other similar
- custom maven archetypes

These are all valid approaches.
